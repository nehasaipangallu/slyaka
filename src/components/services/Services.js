              <strong>Android App Development</strong>
            </h5>
            Android app development is a process for building mobile
            applications that run on mobile devices. These applications can
            either be pre-installed or downloaded and installed by the user
            later. They use the network capabilities of the device to work
            computing resources remotely. Hence, the android app development
            process requires creating software that can be installed on the
            device, and enabling backend services for data access through APIs,
            and testing the application on target devices.

            operational necessities. Programming software to give programmers
            tools such as text editors, compilers, linkers, debuggers and other
            tools to create code. Application software (applications or apps) to
